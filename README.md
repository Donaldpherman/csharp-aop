Doing things without writing code is the dream of any developer. In this article, we will learn a pattern that makes things happen without writing a line of code or quite. The philosophy is the AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming). This technique is widely used in Java and helps to keep high-quality standards with low effort. Today we will learn how to use it also in .net core project with no pain.

This repo is the code base used for the medium article [How to Improve .Net Applications with AOP]().
